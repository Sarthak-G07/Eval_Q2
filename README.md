# Eval_Q2

Question 2: Write a program (C/C++) that takes a paragraph input from the user, counts the frequency of
each character (excluding spaces and punctuation), and prints the frequencies. Additionally, set up a
GitHub Action that automatically runs this program to check for common coding errors (like using
uninitialized variables). Initialize a Git repository, commit your changes, and push the repository to
GitHub. Share the repository link.<br>
â€¢ Expected Output: A GitHub repository URL with the C program for character frequency analysis,
along with the GitHub Action configuration.
